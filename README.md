# Epic Game
The game allows players to mint one of three characters and team up with other players to defeat a boss. Players may attack the boss, dealing and taking damage. Character attributes (attack, hp, etc...) are stored on chain and can be [viewed on opensea](https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/0xf2f7af84730d54ebf3bee12b18a5a410ee55ba1c/2).

Contract based on a Buildspace project 🦄.

It does a couple things: 
- mints player NFTs
- Allows players to attack the boss character 🏹

The theme of the project is easily configurable within the [deploy file](./scripts/deploy.js). I chose gen 4 pokemon in anticipation of a new game release.

It's deployed on Rinkeby.
